# DEVSU CHALLENGE

## Notes Interviewee

- It just have been built one microservice.
- The solution has been written in Java and SpringBoot entirely.
- About the endpoints: 
  - the client and account resources handle an RESTFUL API each one, whereas the transaction resource only has the create endpoint.
  - the endpoint `/reportes` works but there are some pending fixes to do
